# norns-tuning
tuning mod for norns

# installation and usage

directory must be named `tuning`, e.g.
```
cd ~/dust/code
git clone git@github.com:catfact/norns-tuning.git tuning
```

with the mod enabled, tuning is applied globally, to all scripts which use `musicutil.note_num_to_freq` and variants. 

the mod menu allows tuning selection, and specification of root note and base frequency.

# TODO

- parse external .lua / .scala files in addition to built-in tunings
